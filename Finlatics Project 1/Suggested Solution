My Advice:
No,I would not suggest acquisition of small businesses.Acquiring smaller businesses
carries risks like cultural misalignment, integration difficulties. If the company struggles
with its current margins, taking on more businesses could increase financial strain.
Acquisitions could be considered later, but only when the company stabilizes its
profitability and builds the capacity to integrate new businesses effectively.
