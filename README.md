Problem Statement:
An Indian IT Service and product company has an employee base of 5000+ resources all
over the globe. Around 73% of the resources are based out of India (Mumbai, Pune,
Hyderabad and Ahmedabad). Total employee strength includes 690 contractors out of
which 60% are in India, 5% in Australia and 7% in Asia Pacific centres. These contractors
are on an average 1.4 times costlier than permanent employees.
Its customers are across 35 countries mainly in the US (32%), Middle-east (27%) and
Europe (20%).
Its main business is providing IT solutions and Annual Maintenance Services. Though
they provide IT solutions in all the domains, 46% of their revenue comes from BFSI
sector, 21% is from the Healthcare sector and the rest from other sectors like Retail,
Public sector, Manufacturing, Travel, Entertainment etc.
Its product-based business is providing pre-made softwares and applications for
companies. The three products they offer are DevOps bundle, cybersecurity and digital
marketing. 90% of revenue comes from the digital marketing product.
It enjoys a good margin from BFSI (42%) and Retail (39%) sectors and also from
business in the US (48%) and Europe (44%) region. The margin is very low in business in
India (9%) and other Asia Pacific countries (14%).
It is finding it difficult to be at par with its competitors on a year-on-year margin
improvement rate which is 11% v/s 26% by other comparable IT companies in India.

Suggested Solution:
To address this, it is thinking of acquiring smaller organisations which specialise in
niche technologies and having a larger customer base which will help them in
increasing its employee base and expand the business with cross-sell opportunities.

My Advice:
No,I would not suggest acquisition of small businesses.Acquiring smaller businesses
carries risks like cultural misalignment, integration difficulties. If the company struggles
with its current margins, taking on more businesses could increase financial strain.
Acquisitions could be considered later, but only when the company stabilizes its
profitability and builds the capacity to integrate new businesses effectively.
